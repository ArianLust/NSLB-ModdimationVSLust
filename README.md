# NSLB-ModdimationVsLust
A unity-standalone 2-10 player remake of the Mario vs. Luigi gamemode from the New Super Mario Bros DS download game but now modded by 2 idiots. 

Includes the 5 default levels (Grassland, Bricks, Castle, Pipes, and Ice), along with a handful of custom levels to battle on! 
All power-ups are included and remain faithful to their original counterparts, along with the new addition of the Propeller Suit & Ice Flower!
